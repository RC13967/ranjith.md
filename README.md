       <h2>Differences between 'div', 'section', and, 'article'</h2>
       <h3>Article</h3>
       <div><p>An article should make sense on its own, and it should be possible to distribute it independently from the rest of the web site.If we had to define about different browsers(chrome, opera, firefox,etc) in a web page, we use article tag for the description of each</p></div>
   <h3>Section</h3>
   <div><p>section means that the content inside is grouped. typically with a heading. A web page could normally be split into sections for introduction, content, and contact information. </p></div>
<h3>Div</h3>
<div><p> This should be used only when no other semantic element like article or section is appropriate. Section gathers a specific and strong semantic purpose, where, div has only a generic, non-specific meaning and no semantic purpose.</p></div>  
</article>
